## ðŸ“¥ Input Design

### Overview
Input design is the process of converting user-provided information into a format that can be processed by the system. It ensures the data entered is accurate, secure, and easy to use, with minimum complexity and delay.

### Key Considerations
- What data should be entered?
- How should the data be arranged or coded?
- Providing clear dialogue for users entering data.
- Validating inputs and handling errors gracefully.

### Objectives
1. Convert user inputs into system-readable formats.
2. Minimize input errors through validation.
3. Design user-friendly input screens.
4. Provide helpful messages and feedback during data entry.

## ðŸ“¤ Output Design

### Overview
Output design involves presenting information to users in a clear and effective format. It helps in decision-making by showing data about past, present, or future events.

### Key Considerations
- Type and structure of output required.
- Methods of presenting output (on-screen, print, etc.).
- Design of documents, reports, or notifications.

### Objectives
- Provide meaningful information to end-users.
- Highlight critical events, warnings, or confirmations.
- Ensure outputs are easy to read and interpret.

## ðŸ§  System Analysis

### ðŸ›  Existing System

#### 1. Image Restoration Methods
- **Description:** Uses priors and mathematical models for image recovery.
- **Advantages:**
  - Good for restoring 3D scene structure.
  - Can recover lost image data.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Dependent on specific priors.
  - May lead to over-enhancement and color saturation.
  - Sensitive to parameter tuning.

#### 2. Image Enhancement Methods
- **Description:** Adjusts pixel values (brightness, contrast) without prior knowledge.
- **Advantages:**
  - Simpler and faster.
  - Improves visible features.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Can produce artifacts like color casts.
  - Ineffective for severe distortions.

#### 3. Deep Learning Methods
- **Description:** Uses neural networks trained on large datasets.
- **Advantages:**
  - State-of-the-art performance.
  - Highly adaptable.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Requires large, high-quality datasets.
  - Performance varies with underwater conditions.

### ðŸŒŠ Proposed System - WWPF (Weighted Wavelet Visual Perception Fusion)

#### Description
The WWPF approach enhances underwater images through a combination of:
- **Attenuation-map-guided color correction**
- **Global and local contrast enhancement**
- **Wavelet-based visual perception fusion**

#### Advantages
- Accurate color correction using attenuation maps.
- Preserves both global and fine image details.
- Wavelet fusion reduces artifacts and improves quality.
- Outperforms existing methods in tests across benchmarks.

#### Disadvantages
- Does not fully address noise suppression.
- Higher computational complexity.
- Sensitive to parameter adjustments in varying conditions.
